# visual-studio-shortcut

## go back
When you command-click to jump to a variableâ€™s definition in Visual Studio Code, you can return to your previous location using the "Go Back" command. On macOS, the default shortcut is:

Command + Option + Left Arrow

Alternatively, on Windows or Linux, you can use:

Alt + Left Arrow

You can also access this command from the Command Palette by pressing Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) and typing "Go Back."

This lets you navigate back through your editing history after jumping to a definition.
